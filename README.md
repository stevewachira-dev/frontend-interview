# frontend-interview

## Project Goal
Build a small UI that lets a user search a dataset, view results, and open item details.

## Requirements
- Search
- Filters by name or tags (not case-insensitive)
- Input should either include a button to submit search or debounce input by ~200-300ms
- Results view
- Render filtered results in a list
- Show empty state if no results
- Each result shows name, category, rating, price
- Details view
- Clicking a result shows a details panel (can be inline or modal)
- Details show full description and tags

## Bonus
- Show loading state while searching
- Basic accessibility (labels, focus, semantic HTML)
- Basic styling with Tailwind (clean, not bloated)

## Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/youth-inc/frontend-interview.git
cd frontend-interview
npm install
npm run dev
```
